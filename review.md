# Topics that you should review

The most important topics to review for this course from any source are the following:

-	Displaying quantitative data
-	Summarizing quantitative data
-	Modeling data distributions (especially z-scores and normal distributions)
-	Exploring bivariate numerical data (correlation and linear regression)
-	Sampling Distributions (especially of means)
-	Confidence Intervals (especially of means)
-	Significance Tests (hypothesis testing – especially about means)

Below are three sources of review material; all of them cover the topics and are free to use. It is a matter of person preference as to which one you prefer.

Please do a few practice problems from the source that you choose though. It is very easy to convince yourself that you understand something well because you watched a video or read a chapter, but this is not a good test of understanding. Being able to do relevant problems is a much better test.

## Readings from STA 309

The reading assignments from STA 309 for these topics. I’ve included the STA 309 syllabus to help. Try reading the chapter and looking at the end of chapter review exercises. Your student solutions manual (in Pearson, with the etext) has solutions to all of the odd numbered problems.

## Against All Odds videos

The [Against All Odds video series](https://www.learner.org/courses/againstallodds/) by the Annenberg Foundation is excellent, but some of the videos feel a bit dated. Each video is about 15 minutes long and covers the topic at a basic level with examples. There are also student exercises that you should work.

## Khan Academy videos

The [Khan Academy intro stats videos](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) are also worth watching. The advantage that they have over the A/P stats series is that each one is shorter (although there are more of them because topics are more broken out) and a little more contemporary. Again, you should work the exercises that go with the videos.
